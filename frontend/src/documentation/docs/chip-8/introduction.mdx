# Introduction to CHIP-8

**CHIP-8** is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker in the mid-1970s. It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers.

Unlike modern game consoles that run complex operating systems, CHIP-8 is a **Virtual Machine (VM)**. It doesn't exist as a physical chip; instead, it is a software specification that runs on top of other hardware.

## Why Build a CHIP-8 Emulator?

In the emulation community, CHIP-8 is considered the "Hello World" of emulator development. It is the perfect starting point because:

1.  **Simplicity:** It has only 35 opcodes (instructions).
2.  **Documentation:** The specification is well-documented and standard.
3.  **Reward:** You can play classic games like *Pong*, *Tetris*, and *Space Invaders* once you finish.

## Technical Specifications

To build an emulator, you need to simulate the following hardware components:

### Memory
CHIP-8 has direct access to up to **4KB (4,096 bytes)** of RAM.
- **0x000 to 0x1FF:** Reserved for the interpreter (the font data usually goes here).
- **0x200 to 0xFFF:** Program ROM and data.

### Registers
- **16 General Purpose Registers:** 8-bit registers named `V0` through `VF`.
- **Index Register (I):** A 16-bit register used to store memory addresses.
- **Program Counter (PC):** Points to the current instruction in memory.

### Display
The graphics are monochrome and very low resolution:
- **Resolution:** 64 x 32 pixels.
- **Drawing:** Sprites are XORed onto the screen. If a pixel is turned off by drawing, the `VF` register is set to 1 (collision detection).

### Stack
A 16-level stack is used to store the Program Counter (
