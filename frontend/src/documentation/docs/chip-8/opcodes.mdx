# Basic Opcodes

CHIP-8 has 35 opcodes, which are all **2 bytes (16 bits)** long. Because memory is 1 byte wide, we must fetch two bytes from memory and merge them to form a full opcode.

## Opcode Format

An opcode is often represented as a hexadecimal number, like `0xA2F0`. We use variables to describe parts of the opcode:

| Variable | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **NNN** | A 12-bit address (lowest 12 bits) |
| **nn** or **kk** | An 8-bit constant (lowest 8 bits) |
| **n** | A 4-bit constant (lowest 4 bits) |
| **x** | A 4-bit register identifier (second nibble) |
| **y** | A 4-bit register identifier (third nibble) |

For example, in the instruction `7xkk` (ADD Vx, byte), if the opcode is `0x7305`:
- `x` = 3 (Register V3)
- `kk` = 05 (Add 5 to V3)

## Essential Instructions

Here are the most fundamental opcodes you need to get a ROM running.

### 00E0 - CLS
**Clear the display.**
Sets all pixels on the screen to 0 (off).

### 1NNN - JP addr
**Jump to location NNN.**
The interpreter sets the Program Counter (PC) to `NNN`.
```c
PC = NNN;
